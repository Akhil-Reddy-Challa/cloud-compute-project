# Project Abstract

An interactive web application that explores the real-world Retail data from 84.51Â°/Kroger (anonymized). 
The analysis performed around the dataset is mostly based on the below questions.
1. How does customer engagement change over time?
	- Do households spend less or more?
	- What categories are growing or shrinking with changing customer engagement?
	- How might we re-engage customers within the store? Or within a specific category?
2. Which demographic factors (e.g. household size, presence of children, income) appear to affect customer engagement?

Analysis performed on the above data-set and queries can be used to drive better customer engagement in the stores.
