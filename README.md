# Project Abstract

As data volume, variety and velocity accelerate, organizations need to leverage modern data engineering. Every industry is being disrupted by data. In healthcare and life sciences, genomic data enable targeted drug discovery and personalized medicine. In financial services, alternative and third-party data provide increasingly vital investment signals.  In retail and consumer packaged goods, demand forecasting, pricing and inventory data, deliver order of magnitude efficiencies.  Azure and Cloud Computing provides an opportunity to deploy Software application solutions easier, faster, better and at scale.

For the mid-term group project, we will explore real-world Retail data from 84.51°/Kroger (anonymized) to create an interactive Web Application in Azure Cloud.   You will have the ability to focus on innovative problem solving solutions using Azure technology stack.  Goal is to work on solutions that will make life easier for a Retail shopper.  Be creative and put yourself into the shopper’s shoes.  Focus on the core principle, "Make the Customer's Life Easier"

Below are the two questions you are looking to answer:

1. How does customer engagement change over time?

Do households spend less or more?
What categories are growing or shrinking with changing customer engagement?
How might we re-engage customers within the store? Or within a specific category?
2. Which demographic factors (e.g. household size, presence of children, income) appear to affect customer engagement?

How do they affect customer engagement with certain categories?
Here is an example of the dashboard.  Your dashboard does not need to be this fancy.
